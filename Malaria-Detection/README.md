# Malaria Detection

The objective of this project is to build an efficient computer vision model to detect malaria. The model should identify whether the image of a red blood cell is infected with malaria or not, and classify the image as parasitized or uninfected, respectively.

## Working with Large Datasets in Google Colab using Google Drive

This project utilizes a large dataset for testing and training purposes, which is hosted on Google Drive to ensure efficient access and utilization. To get started, follow these steps:

**Dataset Access:**
- The dataset is stored on Google Drive for your convenience.
- A shared link will provide you access to the dataset files.

**Google Colab Setup:**
- Google Colab is the platform we'll use for running the project.
- It offers free access to GPUs and TPUs, allowing us to work with data-intensive tasks efficiently.

**Accessing the Colab Notebook:**
- The main project notebook is provided in this repository. Click on the `.ipynb` file to open it in Google Colab.
- Alternatively, you can clone this repository to your local machine and upload the notebook to Google Colab.

**Setting Up Google Drive Integration:**
- The notebook is set up to integrate with your Google Drive seamlessly.
- It will mount your Google Drive to the Colab environment, enabling direct access to the dataset files.

**Running the Notebook:**
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the project.
- The code snippets and explanations guide you through the process step by step.

**Accessing the Dataset:**
- Within the notebook, you'll find code that accesses the dataset from your Google Drive.
- Make sure the dataset files are located in a directory named `dataset` in your Google Drive root folder.

**Running Code Blocks:**
- Run code blocks that involve loading or processing the dataset.
- As the dataset is quite large, be patient during loading and training steps.

**Saving Results:**
- If you generate outputs or results, consider saving them in a separate directory.
- This ensures your work is preserved even if you close the Colab session.

**Cleaning Up:**
- Once you're done working, you can disconnect the Google Drive integration and close the Colab session.

**Project Replication:**
- If you want to replicate this project on your own Google Drive, follow these steps:
  - Create a folder named `project_name` in your Google Drive.
  - Upload the notebook to this folder.
  - Create a subfolder named `dataset` and upload the dataset files there.
