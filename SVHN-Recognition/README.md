# SVHN-Recognition

SVHN Repository

This repository focuses on working with the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset, one of the most popular image recognition datasets in the field of deep learning. The dataset consists of over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. Recognizing objects in natural scenes is an intriguing task in deep learning, with various applications that can benefit from processing visual information using machine learning algorithms.

The SVHN dataset has been utilized by Google to enhance the quality of maps. They developed neural networks that automatically transcribe address numbers from a patch of pixels. By associating the transcribed number with a known street address, the location of the building it represents can be pinpointed accurately.

This repository aims to provide resources and code examples for working with the SVHN dataset and developing image recognition models. It primarily focuses on using a Jupyter Notebook file for modeling, without any Python .py files. The provided resources cover preprocessing techniques, model architectures, and evaluation metrics to assist you in starting your own SVHN projects.

Dataset

The SVHN dataset file, Data/SVHN_single_grey1.h5, is properly tracked and managed by Git LFS (Git Large File Storage). Git LFS handles large file storage efficiently, allowing seamless version control and collaboration.

Repository Structure
The repository has the following structure:

notebooks: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files that cover different aspects of the SVHN project, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation metrics.

README.md: The main documentation file you are currently reading.

.gitignore: A file that specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git, such as temporary files or data files that shouldn't be committed to the repository.

.gitattributes: A file that specifies how Git should handle certain files, such as large files tracked by Git LFS.

Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/svhn-repository.git


1.  Install the required dependencies, if any, mentioned in the notebook files.
2.  Explore the Jupyter Notebook files in the notebooks directory to understand different aspects of working with the SVHN dataset and building image recognition models.
3.  Customize the notebook files to fit your specific requirements and experiment with different preprocessing techniques, model architectures, and evaluation metrics.
4.  Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the results, modify the code as needed, and experiment with your own ideas.
