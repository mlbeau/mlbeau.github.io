# Active Investing with Network Analysis: Portfolio Simulation

Welcome to the GitHub repository project on active investing in the asset management industry. This project aims to explore 
the world of active investing, where the goal is to outperform the average returns of the stock market. Portfolio managers in this 
industry track specific indices and strive to exceed their performance by curating their own portfolios.

## Overview

In the pursuit of better returns, portfolio construction becomes a critical endeavor. The process involves careful selection of 
stocks with a higher potential for delivering superior returns compared to the chosen tracking index. For instance, the commonly 
followed **S&P 500** index. In this project, we take a novel approach by leveraging Network Analysis to facilitate stock selection 
and portfolio creation.

## Project Goals

- Apply Network Analysis to identify a diverse and promising set of stocks.
- Construct two distinct portfolios using the identified stocks.
- Simulate the performance of the portfolios over a one-year investment horizon.
- Compare the simulated portfolio performance against the S&P 500 index.

## Methodology

Our methodology draws inspiration from the research paper titled **[Dynamic portfolio strategy using a clustering 
approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.03058.pdf)**. This paper outlines an innovative strategy for portfolio management that aligns 
well with our project's objectives. We'll adapt and implement the concepts presented in this paper to guide our stock selection and 
portfolio creation process.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`data/`**: Datasets for the analysis, retrieved via web scraping and the Yahoo Finance API.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebook detailing the step-by-step analysis and portfolio simulation.
- **`src/`**: Jupyter notebook detailing the step-by-step analysis and portfolio simulation.
- **`results/`**: Outcome of the portfolio simulation and performance comparison detailed in the notebook.
- **`references/`**: Relevant research papers, articles, and resources.

## Getting Started

To replicate our analysis and portfolio simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Portfolio-Optimization.git`
